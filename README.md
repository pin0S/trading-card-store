# Problem that needs solving & why it need solving

Currently there are no dedicated marketplaces to sell basketball cards. Sellers and buyers are forced to user marketplaces like Ebay, Gumtree or Auction houses to buy and sell basketball cards. Meaning that the buyers are forced to check all these locations for the cards they want and the sellers therefore lose out on demand as buyers might not know that certain cards are listed in certain locations. 

This means basketball cards can get lost in the sea of other items on these marketplaces and the user experience isn't built to highlight the unique features of each card.

Thus this problem needs to be solved so that the buying, selling and finding of cards can be centralised in one place. This means that sellers can get the best price for their cards and buyers can easily find the cards they are looking for. 

This app aims to solve this issue by providing basketball card collectors with a two sided marketplace to find, buy and sell basketball cards.
